Task3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The price of a car depends on lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car,features of the car,horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more.Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning.So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

Training a car price prediction model can indeed be an exciting project in machine learning. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can take to build such a model:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset containing information about various cars, including features like brand, model, year, mileage, horsepower, fuel type, transmission type, number of cylinders, etc. You can obtain this data from sources like online car marketplaces, APIs, or by scraping websites.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations through techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding. You may also need to normalize or scale numerical features to ensure they're on a similar scale.

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones that might improve the predictive power of the model. For example, you could derive features like the age of the car from the year, or calculate the horsepower per cylinder.

Splitting the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression tasks. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM.

Model Training: Train the selected model using the training data. During training, the model will learn the patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (car price).

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, or R-squared on the testing set. This step helps you assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen algorithm to optimize its performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used for this purpose.

Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into production where it can be used to predict car prices for new instances.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure its accuracy and relevance over time.
